    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD
  }
});
```

- Verify the app password was generated correctly

#### 2. **Emails not sending**

- Check if Gmail is blocking the connection

#### 3. **OTP not working**

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by adding to your `.env`:

```env
NODE_ENV=development
DEBUG=nodemailer:*
```

### Testing with Different Email Providers

To use other email providers, modify the transporter configuration:

```javascript
// For Outlook/Hotmail
this.transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
  service: 'outlook',
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD
  }
});

// For custom SMTP
this.transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
  host: 'smtp.yourprovider.com',
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASSWORD
  }
});
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### OTP Security
- OTPs expire after 10 minutes
- OTPs can only be used once
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- OTPs are automatically cleaned up

### Email Security
- Use app passwords, not main account passwords
- Emails are sent over secure connections
- No sensitive data stored in email content

### Rate Limiting
- Implemented to prevent email spam
- Configurable limits in environment variables

## üìä Monitoring

### Email Logs
Check backend console for email sending logs:
```
OTP email sent successfully: <message-id>
Welcome email sent successfully: <message-id>
Password change email sent successfully: <message-id>
```

### Database Monitoring
Monitor the `otps` collection for:
- OTP creation and usage
- Expired OTP cleanup
- Rate limiting effectiveness

## üéØ Next Steps

After setting up email functionality:

1. **Test all flows** thoroughly
2. **Customize email templates** if needed
3. **Set up email monitoring** for production
4. **Configure backup email service** for reliability
